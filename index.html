	<div class="main" id="section1">
		<p>There were not many fields</p>
		<p>In which you had hopes for me</p>
		<p>But sport was one of them.</p>
		<p>On my twenty-first birthday</p>
		<p>I was selected to play</p>
		<p>For Grangegorman Mental Hospital</p>
		<p>In an away game</p>
		<p>Against Mullingar Mental Hospital.</p>
		<p>I was a patient</p>
		<p>In B Wing.</p>
		<p>You drove all the way down,</p>
		<p>Fifty miles,</p>
		<p>To Mullingar to stand</p>
		<a href="#section2"></a><p>On the sidelines and observe me.</p></a>
	</div>
	<br>
	<div class="main" id="section2">
		<p>I was fearful I would let down</p>
		<p>Not only my team but you.</p>
		<p>It was Gaelic football.</p>
		<p>I was selected as goalkeeper.</p>
		<p>There were big country men</p>
		<p>On the Mullingar Mental Hospital team,</p>
		<p>Men with gapped teeth, red faces,</p>
		<p>Oily, frizzy hair, bushy eyebrows.</p>
		<p>Their full forward line</p>
		<p>Were over six foot tall</p>
		<p>Fifteen stone in weight.</p>
		<p>All three of them, I was informed,</p>
		<a href="#section3"></a><p>Cases of schizophrenia.</p></div></a>
	</div>
	<br>
	<div class="main" id="section3">
		<p>There was a rumour</p>
		<p>That their centre-half forward</p>
		<p>Was an alcoholic solicitor</p>
		<p>Who, in a lounge bar misunderstanding,</p>
		<p>Had castrated his best friend</p>
		<p>But that he had no memory of it.</p>
		<p>He had meant well - it was said.</p>
		<p>His best friend had to emigrate</p>
		<a href="#section4"></a><p>To Nigeria.</p></div></a>
	</div>
	<br>
	<div class="main" id="section4">
		<p>To my surprise,</p>
		<p>I did not flinch in the goals.</p>
		<p>I made three or four spectacular saves,</p>
		<p>Diving full stretch to turn</p>
		<p>A certain goal around the corner,</p>
		<p>Leaping high to tip another certain goal</p>
		<p>Over the bar for a point.</p>
		<p>It was my knowing</p>
		<p>That you were standing on the sideline</p>
		<p>That gave me the necessary motivation -</p>
		<p>That will to die</p>
		<p>That is as essential to sportsmen as to artists.</p>
		<p>More than anybody it was you</p>
		<p>I wanted to mesmerise, and after the game -</p>
		<p>Grangegorman Mental Hospital</p>
		<p>Having defeated Mullingar Mental Hospital</p>
		<p>By 14 Goals and 38 points to 3 goals and 10 points -</p>
		<p>Sniffing your approval, you shook hands with me.</p>
		<a href="#section5"></a><p>'Well played, son'.</p></a>
	</div>
	<br>
	<div class="main" id="section5">
		<p>I may not have been mesmeric</p>
		<p>But I had not been mediocre.</p>
		<p>In your eyes I had achieved something at last.</p>
		<p>On my twenty-first birthday I had played on a winning team</p>
		<p>The Grangegorman Mental Hospital team.</p>
		<p>Seldom if ever again in your eyes</p>
		<p>Was I to rise to these heights.</p>
